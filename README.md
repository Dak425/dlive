# DLive API Client
This is a package to make it easier to interact with DLive's GraphQL API.

I'm mostly writing this to learn Go, so any advice and criques are much appreciated.

# Examples
* Send Query to API - [Example](https://github.com/Dak425/dlive/blob/master/example/send_query.go)
* Send Query to API(Async) - [Example](https://github.com/Dak425/dlive/blob/master/example/send_query_async.go)
* Stream Chat Messages - [Example](https://github.com/Dak425/dlive/blob/master/example/stream_chat.go)
